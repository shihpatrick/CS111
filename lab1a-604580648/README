**Please use one of my five late passes.**

lab1a.c: Contains all the code used for the lab. I borrowed from the following sources to develop my code. 

POLLING: http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/multipage/pollman.html
 Used this website to understanding polling and the functionalities behind it. I used the code example as a framework for my code. 

CHARACTER AT A TIME, FULL DUPLEX TERMINAL I/O: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Noncanon-Example.html
 Used the example to develop noncanon terminal with no echo. Code was borrowed from above source.

Makefile: make, clean, dist
  make - compiles and builds executable
  clean - cleans executable
  dist - packages lab1a.c, Makefile, README into tar file
